    "    API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the methods, data formats, and conventions that developers should follow when integrating their software with the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tExample: One real-life example of API usage is when you book a flight or hotel through a travel website. The travel website typically integrates with various airlines' and hotels' APIs to fetch information about available flights, hotel rooms, prices, and make bookings on your behalf. The website communicates with these APIs to retrieve data and perform actions, providing you with a seamless booking experience without having to visit each airline or hotel's website individually."
